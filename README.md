I've downloaded data from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data with contains 186880 records of the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).
Every cell contains 17 information about car (VIN, make, model etc.) that is separated by comma. Then I split it into list and make separate sheet to easy work on it, also colour cells for BEV and PHEV.
The program is using two threats, one to count time and show user info about it, second to process Excel file. When process is ended, it ends first threat.
